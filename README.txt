This script verifibly supports most major art sites. Features specific to a select few are included (detailed within HELP under the program)
Support for other sites might come later if enough demand is demonstrated

What this program does...
>This program is used to crawl a website and download user requested items to be stored on the user's computer
>The program is intended to work with art portfolios where it can be difficult to arrange works in collections
>With this program, the user may access, browse, and search through whatever collections they design

Using the upload function... 
>Copy the entry data from whatever site and save it to input.txt (an example of the full data is shown below)
>This program verifiably supports Firefox, Brave, and Chrome browsers but might work for others
>You can scan multiple entries at once. Just make sure to seperate each entry with a blank line
>Also, make sure there are TWO empty lines at the bottom of sauce.txt before scanning
>Use the scan function and the script will automatically scan whatever is in input.txt
>It's good practice to clear input.txt afterwards. If you don't, things can get kinda messy
>Numbers (such as 4 in 4uu or 2 in 2b) are erased. Manually readd them or they won't appear in search results
>Alternatively, add the item to exceptions.txt to do this automatically. Use this convention: persona_ persona_3
>You can also add whatever comments you want to work at the bottom of each entry

Using the search function...
>Enter whatever terms you want. Artist, tag, langauge, whatever
>To exclude a term, just enter '/' before it (ex: /pastel)
>The script will search through sauce.txt and return whatever codes match
>Only codes that match all search terms are displayed

Show more info...
>After a search, input the number corresponding to the code of a work to see the full entry as logged in sauce.txt
>You can also type 0 to make a manual search. This will display the info of whatever work you type the code of
>Because of the way characters are stored, Japanese text will look screwy (can't be bothered to fix this atm :P )

Show collections...
>Used to look at stats for a certain category (Arists, Tags, Characters, etc.)
>Tells the script to look for unique items in the specified category and collect them
>The results can be viewed by most popular or ascending alphabetically/page count
Here's an example of sample input from the Firefox browser. Chrome and Brave look different but will also work

this is where you can add comments. You can just ignore this if you have nothing to add
